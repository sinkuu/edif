# edif-rs

A Rust library that implements [EDIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDIF) (Electronic Design Interchange Format) netlist parser, AST, and netlist structure.
This is not fully compliant to EDIF specification at all yet, and only supports processing small subset of EDIF produced by
recent Xilinx Vivado.
